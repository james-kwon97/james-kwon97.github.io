      <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Few months back, a time when I made an ethical decision was during a visit to a restaurant. After enjoying a meal, I noticed that the waiter had forgotten to include the drinks on the bill. Honesty and integrity were important to me, and I have always believed in treating others fairly. Thus, I decided to inform the waiter about the oversight and requested that they add the drinks to the bill. To my surprise, they informed me that the drinks were complimentary. This experience reinforced my belief that being honest not only upholds personal values but can also lead to positive outcomes. Reflecting on this decision now, I feel proud that I upheld my principles and contributed to maintaining honesty in the situation.</p>

      <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>I grew up in a cultural and religious environment where honesty and righteous living were paramount. The fact that I was raised in a Christian family has had a significant impact on my values and identity. The teachings and principles of Christianity, such as the importance of truthfulness, integrity, and compassion, were instilled in me from a young age. The Christian values upheld by my family and friends provided a strong foundation for my moral compass. As a result, the combination of my cultural background and Christian upbringing influenced my values and led me to favour honesty and righteousness in my actions and decisions.</p>

      <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>My strengths in communication skills and time management will play an important role in supporting my learning journey. My strong communication skills will allow me to actively participate in discussions, effectively express my ideas, and collaborate with others. Clear and concise communication will enable me to interact meaningfully with my peers and facilitators. In addition, my time management skills will help me stay organized, prioritize tasks, and create a well-structured study plan. By managing my time effectively, I will be able to devote sufficient time to studying, researching, and completing assignments to ensure a productive and successful learning experience.</p>

      <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>My limitations, would be a lack of creativity which may affect my learning journey and professional development. The lack of creativity could hinder my ability to come up with innovative ideas and approach problem-solving from different angles. It might require extra effort to think outside the box and explore alternative perspectives. However, I acknowledge my limitations and can work to overcome them by being inspired, using creative thinking techniques, and implementing strategies to improve my work quality.</p>

      <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>During a University group project, there was a clash of ideas and a lack of consensus among team members, leading to disagreements and a strained atmosphere. To address this, I tried implementing strategies such as active listening, encouraging open dialogue, and finding common ground to build upon. While these strategies helped to some extent, the tension persisted, and we struggled to find a cohesive direction. Reflecting on this experience, I realize that in addition to the strategies I employed, I could have suggested utilizing a structured decision-making process, such as brainstorming or voting, to facilitate a democratic approach. Furthermore, promoting effective communication channels from the outset could have helped prevent or mitigate the resistance and tension.</p>
