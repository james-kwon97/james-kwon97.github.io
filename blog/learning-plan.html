      <h2 class="heading-two">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <br>
      <p> My long-term goal is becoming a skilled and versatile full stack
      developer. I aim to master various programming languages, frameworks, and
      tools to create robust and user-friendly projects. By constantly learning
      and adapting to evolving industry trends, I aspire to contribute to
      innovative projects, collaborate with talented teams, and ultimately make
      a meaningful impact in the world of full stack development.

      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
      When it comes to learning, one of my key strengths would be my eagerness
      and curiosity to explore new areas of knowledge. I feel comfortable in
      situations where I can explore new topics and expand my knowledge in
      different areas. However, one of my limitations is the amount of time it
      takes for me to become fully focused on studying. I sometimes need a
      transition period to develop a focused mindset. Once I get past this
      initial phase, I am able to immerse myself in the subject matter and give
      my full attention to the learning process. Recognizing this limitation, I
      strive to implement strategies and techniques to help me improve my
      concentration and minimize distractions, so that I can achieve a state of
      increased focus and productivity when studying.

      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
      During my time at Dev Academy, I would like to develop several
      non-technical core skills to increase my overall effectiveness. First and
      foremost, I want to overcome my fear of meeting new people, especially as
      an introvert. By challenging myself to step out of my comfort zone, engage
      in networking opportunities, and actively participate in social
      situations, I want to build confidence and make meaningful connections
      with other students, mentors, and industry professionals. I also
      understand the importance of effective collaboration and teamwork in a
      professional setting. To further develop my ability to work effectively
      with team members on group projects, I want to enhance my communication
      skills, active listening, and empathy. By actively participating in group
      discussions, taking different perspectives, and constructively
      contributing constructively to the team's common goals, I want to foster a
      collaborative environment where ideas can flourish, and shared successes
      can be achieved.

      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
      In order to effectively manage my workload in this program, I have made a
      commitment to fully engage by resigning from my full-time job. This allows
      me to prioritize my learning and actively engage with other peers and
      facilitators. Whenever I feel unsure or overwhelmed, I will seek support
      from my peers and facilitators, leveraging their advice and expertise. I
      also understand the importance of taking breaks and stepping away from the
      screen when things start to pile up and stress takes its toll. By allowing
      myself time to rest and recharge, I can regain clarity and get back to my
      work with renewed focus and energy.

      <h2>
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
      I commit to seeking help promptly when needed, knowing that timely
      assistance is critical to my success. I will actively engage with my peers
      and moderators on Discord and Slack, seeking their advice and expertise to
      overcome challenges and clarify any uncertainties I may have. In addition
      to the community, I will also utilize the many resources on platforms such
      as YouTube and Google to find solutions.

      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
      Primarily, I anticipate receiving valuable advice and guidance from the
      facilitators, drawing from their expertise and industry knowledge. I also
      look forward to collaborating with my peers, as I believe in the power of
      collective learning. Moreover, I hope to learn from their experiences,
      benefiting from their insights and gaining a broader perspective on the
      subject matter. Ultimately, I trust the Facilitation team's ability to
      create an engaging and supportive environment that fosters growth and
      skill development.

      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things.
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
      In order to maintain a balanced schedule, I have certain off-screen
      commitments that I prioritize. For example, I allocate dedicated time to
      going to the gym because that is part of my physical well-being. I believe
      it's important to take care of my health to increase my overall
      productivity and focus. I also consciously avoid distractions during my allotted study times to ensure that I can fully focus on
      the learning process. By scheduling and
      keeping these commitments, I aim to create a structured and focused
      environment that optimizes my learning experience.
