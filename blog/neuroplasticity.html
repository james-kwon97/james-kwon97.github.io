      <h2 class="heading-two">DISCUSS HOW UNDERSTANDING THE PRINCIPLES OF NEUROPLASTICITY BENEFITS PEOPLE.</h2>
      <br>
      <p> Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to change itself by creating new neural connections. Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity would benefit people in many ways, such as the potential for learning, picking up new skills, health recovery and more. Ultimately, understanding neuroplasticity allows individuals to enhance their well-being and unlock their full potential. It is way more beyond what you think you can possibly achieve.

      <h2>DISCUSS HOW YOU MIGHT ENGAGE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF NEUROPLASTICITY FOR YOUR BENEFIT.
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>Personally for me, the top principle of neuroplasticity that I want to engage with is picking up a new skill and learning something new. As I am new to coding, I want to take part and practice new content that I have learned each day and practice them consistently. Also, avoiding sleep deprivation would boost me with the principles of neuroplasticity in order for me to obtain the best learning.

      <h2>WAYS TO INCREASE NEUROPLASTICITY</h2>
      <br>
      <p>There are various ways to increase your neuroplasticity. Some of the methods include, learning and intellectual simulation, physical exercise, mindfulness and meditation, balanced nutrition and much more.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-two">DISCUSS WHAT IT IS AND WHY IT IS RELEVANT</h2>
      <br>
      <p>A growth mindset when individuals belief that they can develop their abilities and intelligence through dedication and hard-work. It is based on the attitude and efforts of an individual when they face challenges, how they process failures, and how they adapt and evolve as a result. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>IN THIS EXPLORATION, DID ANYTHING SURPRISE YOU? CHANGE FOR YOU?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Certainly. After researching about growth mindset, I realized that I always had a growth mindset but did not commit hard enough to process and learn from my failures. I have also learned that to commit to a growth mindset, I would need to face failure and try my best to get around it for my best learning results.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>HOW WILL YOU INTEGRATE GROWTH MINDSET INTO YOUR LEARNING JOURNEY?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>There are many things I am committed to do in order to integrate growth mindset into my learning journey. Few factors that I would take into account are not avoiding challenges, viewing my mistakes as learning opportunities, seeking feedback and improving on that and setting realistic daily goals.</p>

    <h1 class="heading-one1">BLEND WITH YOUR <br>LEARNING PLAN</h1>
      <h2 class="heading-two">HOW THESE SHAPE OR INFLUENCE YOUR LEARNING PLAN AND STRATEGY.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>My findings of neuroplasticity and growth mindset made me come to a realization that I have been in my comfort zone my whole life. I think that it is time to step out of my comfort zone and attempt new things that I have been avoiding, seeking for feedback and help when needed and to not be afraid of making mistakes. Overall, this will change the thoughts of my original learning plan and strategy and will give me more greater results during my time at Dev Academy.</p>
