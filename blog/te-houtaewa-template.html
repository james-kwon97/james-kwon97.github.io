      Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on
      his peoples enemies. <br />One morning his mother wanted kumara for the
      hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens <br />at Te
      Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his
      mother to prepare the hangi.
      </p>
      <p class="para2">
      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as
      he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa <br />people who lived there. Carrying
      two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the
      journey over the <br />hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach)
      in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. <br />On
      reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka
      (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) <br />situated at the foot of the hill
      Whangatauatia.
      </p>
      <p class="para3">
      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted
      stealing the kai (food). <br />He was immediately recognised.
