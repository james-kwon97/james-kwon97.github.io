      <h2 class="heading-two">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      <br>
      <p> I found that I was not good at actively listening to one another and I often lack in focus when learning new topics I don't enjoy learning. Another idea that I have learnt was how I am able to grow my learning section of my brain through regular coding practices and also trying to code daily.

      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Values, empathy, and self-awareness play important roles in learning and programming. Values act as guiding principles, shaping the decisions and actions of programmers. By aligning their work with ethical values, programmers can develop software that respects privacy and social responsibility. Empathy is essential in understanding the needs and perspectives of end-users, enabling programmers to create user-friendly and meaningful experiences. It fosters collaboration, allowing programmers to work effectively in teams and address diverse user requirements. Self-awareness would help programmers to recognize their own strength and weaknesses. It enables continuous learning and improvement, promoting the adoption of best practices, and avoiding harmful coding practices. By incorporating values, empathy, and self-awareness into their work, programmers can create software that is both technically proficient and socially responsible.

      <h2>
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
      I was surprised when learning about the existence and importance of emotional intelligence. It really hit me when I had read about how important EQ is at a workplace. It indicates success and also is used to identify leaders or team-work people as being able to handle emotions can give you the ability to guide and help people, and it can ultimately make you more happier and successful.

        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
      The most challenging aspects of the core learning was the listening and looping exercise. This was something I had never thought of doing in life and the reason why it was so challenging was because I had to the speaker for 2 minutes and repeat back what they had said without taking in any kind of emotions. It was a new experience for me and I had learnt to listen and repeat to whatever the other person had to say, in a positive manner.

      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
      I believe that there are many skills we need to build in order to become a good software developer. There were a lot of core skills we have learnt such as thinking like a web developer which helps in problem-solving and developing solutions with a user-centric approach. Exploring identity and values helps in aligning personal goals and principles with the work in the coding industry, leading to fulfillment and purpose. Emotional intelligence which enhances teamwork, collaboration, and understanding of future clients' needs. Lastly, effective communication, such as active listening and providing feedback is crucial for successful collaboration and delivering high-quality codes. These core skills collectively contribute to professional growth, career advancement, and the ability to create impactful and innovative solutions in the coding industry.

      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
      No. At first I had thought that learning new core skills was a waste of time. However, after completing 5 weeks of foundations programme, I had learnt that learning to code was not only about learning how to code. It was much more than what I had expected and I realized how important it was reflecting back on myself and what my values were, how to actively listen and give positive feedback, and also how to work together with another person.
