        A time when I was blocked on a simple problem?
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I had a simple problem while coding. The issue was a tiny syntax error:
        instead of writing "element[0]," I mistakenly wrote "element.[0]."
        Frustrated by my inability to spot the error, I decided to step away
        from the screen and sought the help of a friend. By explaining my code
        and thought process to them, I managed to regain clarity. Surprisingly,
        I felt relieved when I discovered that the problem was just a small
        syntax error and not something more significant. This experience taught
        me the values of taking breaks to clear my mind and the rubber ducky
        method which in turn refreshes my thinking process.

      <h2>A time when I elegantly solved a problem?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I was working on one of the JavaScript exercises that required me to
        write a function and calling it. I was quite overwhelmed, but I
        approached the problem step by step and writing pseudocode to break it
        down into smaller manageable tasks. Then when I ran the code, it worked
        flawlessly and I was happy.

      <h2>
        How confident I feel using each of these problem-solving techniques?
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Reflecting on the problem-solving techniques and processes I've used, I
        can confidently say that each one has contributed for me to gain more
        confidence in coding exercises. Pseudocode has been an essential tool,
        allowing me to plan and structure my code before implementation. Trying
        something, even if it feels uncertain, has proven to be an effective way
        to explore different solutions and learn from the outcomes. The rubber
        ducky method has been surprisingly helpful in uncovering syntax errors
        or mistakes by simply explaining my code aloud to an inanimate object.
        Reading error messages has become less intimidating over time, as they
        now serve as valuable clues for identifying and rectifying issues.
        Console.logging has been an excellent way to track the flow of my code
        and debug specific sections. Googling has undoubtedly expanded my
        knowledge and provided insights into different techniques and solutions.
        Asking peers and coaches for help has been crucial in gaining new
        perspectives and finding help when stuck on something for a long time.
        Lastly, reflecting on my process has allowed me to identify areas of
        improvement, refine my problem-solving skills, and approach future
        challenges with even more confidence.

      <h2>A time when I was reluctant to ask for help?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        A time when I found myself reluctant to ask for help was when the
        question I had seemed so simple that I felt embarrassed to ask about it.
        It was basic knowledge that I wasn't entirely sure about, and I didn't
        want others to judge me. Despite my hesitation, I soon realized that
        seeking clarification and guidance is an essential part of the learning
        process. Eventually, I gained the courage to ask my peers about my
        question, and to my surprise, they were more than willing to help
        without any judgment. This experience taught me that no question is too
        small or insignificant, and that reaching out for assistance is an act
        of strength rather than a sign of weakness.
