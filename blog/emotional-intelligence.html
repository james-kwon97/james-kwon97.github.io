      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>EQ is different to IQ as EQ is measuring the ability to control and recognize emotions in yourself and others. Whereas, IQ is measuring cognitive abilities such as problem-solving and logical reasoning. EQ can be strengthened with practice and IQ is considered to be stable throughout life.</p>

      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Emotional intelligence is essential to have as it influences how we relate to one another, informs our choices, and promotes our wellbeing. We are able to understand ourselves, empathize with others, and resolve conflicts when we have emotional intelligence. Our ability to adapt, thrive, and lead with authenticity is made possible by emotional intelligence. It is the foundation of individual development and deep relationships, making it an indispensable resource in every aspect of our life.</p>
